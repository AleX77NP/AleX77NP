> Destiny... fate... dreams... These unstoppable ideals are held deep in the heart of man. As long as there are people who seek freedom in this life, these things will not vanish from the earth.

## And now...technical stuff:

### Lanuages
```python
      if category == "primary":
            print("Go, Python, C++, Java")
      elif category == "conversant":
            print("JavaScript, Scala, sh/bash, C")
      else:
            print("Familiar but stale: Elixir, Swift, C#")
```

### Fields of interest
```go
func main() {
	switch field := os.Getenv("FIELD"); field {
	case "favorite":
		fmt.Println("Distributed Systems, Big Data, Virtualization")
	case "interested":
		fmt.Println("Systems Programming, ML & AI")
	default:.
		fmt.Printf("???")
	}
}
```
