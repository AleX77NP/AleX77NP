## And now...technical stuff:

### Lanuages
```python
      if category == "programming":
            print("Go, Python, C++, Scala, Java, JS/TS")
      elif category == "scripting":
            print("sh/bash, Powershell")
      else:
            print("Familiar but stale: Elixir, Rust, C#, Swift, Kotlin")
```

### Fields of interest
```go
func main() {
	switch field := os.Getenv("FIELD"); field {
	case "favorite":
		fmt.Println("Distributed Systems, Big Data, Virtualization")
	case "interested":
		fmt.Println("Systems Programming, ML & AI")
	default:.
		fmt.Printf("???")
	}
}
```
